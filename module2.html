			CHICKEN
		</div>
		<p>
			Deep-fried chicken wings have long been a staple of Southern cooking. But the concept of cooking wings in peppery hot sauce was born in 1964 at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York, when co-owner Teressa Bellissimo cooked leftover wings in hot sauce as a late-night snack for her son and his friends.

			BEEF
		</div>
		<p>
			Beef cattle are much more widely distributed than dairy cattle because they are harder and can tolerate wider range of physical and climatic conditions. ADVERTISEMENTS: They can survive on sparse pasturage. Beef cattle rearing are also the means of livelihood for thousands of people in many areas of Asia and Africa.

			Sushi (寿司, すし, 鮨, or 鮓) is a traditional food from Japan. The word "Sushi" comes from the Japanese word "Su" (酢) meaning vinegar, and "Meshi" (飯), meaning rice. ... The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables.
